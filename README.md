This is a web application designed to help you study English vocabulary effectively. It leverages React and the Merriam-Webster dictionary API to provide you with word definitions, synonyms, examples, and other valuable resources to enhance your vocabulary. Additionally, the app allows you to practice pronunciation and writing with the word you're studying.

## How It Works

1. **Enter a Word**: When you open the app, you'll be greeted with an input field. Enter the word you want to study.

2. **Retrieve Definitions**: The app will fetch the word's definition from the Merriam-Webster dictionary API.

3. **Explore Resources**: Once the definition is retrieved, you'll be directed to a new page containing comprehensive information about the word. This includes definitions, synonyms, examples, and more to help you understand the word in context.

4. **Pronunciation Assistance**: There is a "Say It" button to assist with pronunciation. Clicking this button will pronounce the word for you to imitate.

5. **Your Turn**: The "Your Turn" section is a text area where you can practice using the word. As you type, the app will keep track of the number of words you've used, allowing you to monitor your progress.

## Development

The app is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. If you'd like to contribute or make modifications, you can follow these steps to set up a development environment:
